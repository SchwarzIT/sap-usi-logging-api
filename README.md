# sap-usi-logging
This reusable component allows the creation of complete, comprehensive logs with almost no effort and extends SAP's standard logging API by powerful features.

Logging error situations instead of debugging them can:
* significantly reduce support efforts
* boost developer productivity
* speed up the processing of tickets
* aid in analyzing bugs that are hard to debug

The solution is:
* based on SAPs application log (Transaction SLG1)
* easy to use
* well documentend
* controlled by customizing (Log levels will control the detail level of the logs)
* completely object-oriented
* backwards compatible up to 7.00 and will work on virtually any SAP system
