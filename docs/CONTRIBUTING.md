# How to contribute
## Inherited rules
The rules listed in the [CONTRIBUTING.md of our main repository][USI_CONTRIBUTING] also apply here. 

This file just adds project specific rules to that baseline.

## Please use "Oldschool ABAP"
As mentionned in the [README.md][README] this project is intended to be compatible with 7.00 and should run on "virtually any SAP system".

This means that new functions introduced with ABAP 7.4 are off limits for this project.

## Naming conventions
Please check the [naming conventions][NAMING] carefully before creating new objects.

## Consider the central concepts
Please ensure you are familiar with the [central concepts][CONCEPTS] of the API before writing any code.
